# PMA Easy Export-Import Slicer
Intended to chop up PhpMyAdmin SQL export files into smaller chunks so they can be imported better and faster.

Made in 2016, updated sporadically.

# Purpose
Useful if somehow you don't have access to your website's my.ini, php.ini, or .htaccess to set up the larger-than-default import and timeout values when importing large databases into your MySQL or MariaDB unit.

# Stack
WPF, C#, .NET Framework
